# password-generator-js

Description : The aim of this task was to create a password generator that takes series of criteria and generates a unique password. Total of 4 criteria such as capital letters, small letters, numbers and characters were used to develop a unique password. The Html and Css was already given, so i had to only write the javascript to make this password generator functional. The criterias were to be asked as a prompt message and user has a choice of Yes or No, to include or not to include the criteria whilst generating their password. The criterias are matched at random, so as a user you'll have a greater level of security. 

Screenshots:

When users click the generate password button they're automatically taken to series of promt questions,
This prompt message asks how long the user wants the password to be:

Then the user is taken to prompt questions with criterias like this one:

After user selects all of their chosen criteria, the password generator generates them a unique password:

But, if the user fails to chose any of the given criteria, the alert message pops up suggesting they must chose atleast one criteria:
